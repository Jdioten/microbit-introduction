# Development tools

## Code editor

* Text editor
* Language-specific editors
* Platform-specific editors
* We're going to use MicroPython Editor:
  [tech.microbit.org/software/micropython](https://tech.microbit.org/software/micropython/)
* But a locally hosted version is also available, please use that:
  [PythonEditor/editor.html](http://toybox.roadwarrior/PythonEditor/editor.html)

## Compiler or interpreter?

* Compilers transform code to machine-native format
* Interpreter run program code directly
* Python is usually run in an interpreter
 * But micro:bit needs code compiled to native format (.hex)
